512x512
A stylized shield icon with a stylized AI circuit pattern inside, set against a dark blue background. The shield should have a subtle gradient from navy at the top to deep teal at the bottom. In the center of the shield, a white stylized letter “B” (for BaseGuard) should be rendered in a modern sans‑serif font, slightly embossed to give depth. The overall design should convey security and technology, with clean lines and a slightly futuristic feel. No text other than the “B” should appear. The image should be 512 × 512 pixels, fully opaque, and suitable for use as a logo on a web page.
