+"BaseGuard AI" (Full End-to-End Product Prompt)
+
+Act as a Senior Blockchain Security Architect and Agentic AI Engineer.
+Your task is to design a full working product for a Telegram Mini-App called:
+
+🛡️ BaseGuard AI — Smart Contract & Transaction Security Analyzer
+
+Users paste a Base network smart contract address or a transaction hash, and the Agent (powered by OpenxAI Xnodes) fetches, analyzes, and explains what it does in simple English, highlighting risks, backdoors, honeypots, or hidden logic.
+
+The Agent must operate through its own ERC-6551 Token-Bound Account (TBA) to log verified analyses on-chain, proving decentralized trust.
+
+🔥 Your Response MUST Include All Sections Below (Do NOT skip anything):
+1. Executive Summary
+
+What BaseGuard AI does.
+
+Why it solves a critical user pain point.
+
+Why decentralized AI via Xnodes is superior to centralized LLM security tools.
+
+2. Full User Story (Step-by-Step Flow)
+
+Describe the entire UX journey:
+
+User opens BaseGuard AI in Telegram.
+
+User pastes a contract address or transaction hash.
+
+Backend fetches on-chain bytecode / ABI / storage / TX data.
+
+OpenxAI Xnode analyzes:
+
+Functions
+
+Hidden permissions
+
+Upgrade patterns
+
+Dangerous opcodes
+
+External call risks
+
+tx.value, attacker vector, etc.
+
+Agent produces plain-English explanation.
+
+If high-risk → show red warning (“⚠️ This contract can drain your wallet”).
+
+If safe → explain what it does (“Standard swap; no malicious opcodes found”).
+
+Agent optionally publishes a signed on-chain report from its TBA wallet.
+
+User can share report link as a verifiable security certificate.
+
+3. Agent Architecture (Detailed)
+
+Breakdown of every component:
+
+A. ERC-721 Agent NFT
+
+Represents the BaseGuard AI agent.
+
+Gives identity to the analyzer.
+
+B. ERC-6551 Token-Bound Account
+
+Wallet owned by the Agent NFT.
+
+Used to sign:
+
+Analysis reports
+
+Risk attestations
+
+Verification proofs
+
+C. Security Pipeline
+
+Bytecode fetch
+
+Static analysis
+
+ABI decomposition
+
+Simulation (eth_call)
+
+Opcode detection (SELFDESTRUCT, DELEGATECALL, CALLCODE)
+
+Permission map
+
+Logical risk scoring
+
+D. OpenxAI Xnode Workflows
+
+Define every step Xnode must perform:
+
+Data ingestion
+
+Decompile bytecode
+
+Pattern matching for known exploits
+
+Generate summary in natural language
+
+Emit structured JSON risk report
+
+Sign output
+
+E. Backend Orchestrator
+
+Fetch on-chain data
+
+Route tasks to Xnode
+
+Validate Xnode signatures
+
+Store reports
+
+Interact with TBA wallet for attestations
+
+4. Security Analysis Engine
+
+Describe the exact logic the AI must perform:
+
+Contract Analysis
+
+Detect upgrade proxy patterns
+
+Identify owner permissions
+
+Analyze function visibility
+
+Identify unrestricted transferFrom
+
+Check if contract can drain tokens
+
+Look for infinite approvals
+
+Check for malicious mint logic
+
+Analyze constructor edge cases
+
+Identify honeypot conditions
+
+Check LP lock status (optional)
+
+Transaction Analysis
+
+Simulate transaction using eth_call
+
+Decode calldata
+
+Identify fund flow
+
+Show what tokens move where
+
+Detect rug pull or drain pattern
+
+Explain all outputs in plain English
+
+5. Output Specification
+
+Agent must output two forms:
+
+A. Human-readable summary
+
+Example style:
+
+“⚠️ High Risk: This contract contains a backdoor function called withdrawAll() allowing the owner to drain all tokens.”
+
+“✅ Safe: This is a standard Uniswap swap. No malicious behavior detected.”
+
+B. Machine-readable JSON report
+
+Must include:
+
+{
+  "contract": "0x...",
+  "riskScore": 0-100,
+  "riskLevel": "low|medium|high|critical",
+  "flags": ["delegatecall", "upgradeable", "ownerPrivileges"],
+  "functions": {...},
+  "simulation": {...},
+  "recommendation": "avoid / safe with caution / safe",
+  "signature": "0xXnodeSignature"
+}
+
+6. Telegram Mini App UX Flow
+
+Provide screen-by-screen UI description:
+
+Home Screen:
+“Paste a Contract Address or TX Hash to analyze”
+
+Analyzing Screen:
+“Fetching code… Running static analysis… Simulating behavior…”
+
+Result Screen:
+
+Threat summary
+
+Flags
+
+Recommendation
+
+Button: “View On-Chain Verified Report”
+
+Verified Report View:
+Shows transaction hash of the TBA-signed attestation.
+
+History Screen:
+Users can see all past analyses.
+
+Include examples of friendly text responses and warnings.
+
+7. On-Chain Interaction Flow
+
+Explain every transaction performed by BaseGuard TBA:
+
+Agent computes risk report (off-chain).
+
+Agent signs structured data with its TBA wallet.
+
+Relayer submits signed attestations to Base.
+
+On-chain record is stored as immutable proof of analysis.
+
+This proves the analysis was produced by a decentralized agent and not tampered with.
+
+8. Smart Contracts Required
+
+(include function names)
+
+A. BaseGuardAgentNFT.sol
+
+mintAgent()
+
+getAgentWallet()
+
+Metadata
+
+B. BaseGuardAttestation.sol
+
+storeReport(agentWallet, hash, riskLevel)
+
+verify(reportHash)
+
+C. TBA Registry / Factory
+
+(standard ERC-6551 pattern)
+
+9. Backend Architecture (Node.js/TS)
+
+List all services:
+
+router-service (Telegram)
+
+bytecode-service (fetch on-chain code)
+
+analysis-service (calls Xnode)
+
+simulation-service
+
+relayer-service
+
+attestation-service
+
+database (Postgres)
+
+cache (Redis)
+
+Include API routes:
+
+/analyze/address
+
+/analyze/tx
+
+/report/store
+
+/report/verify
+
+/history
+
+10. Risk & Safety Requirements
+
+Xnode must sign responses.
+
+All reports require expiry timestamp.
+
+Nonces to prevent replay.
+
+Gas buffer: minimum $2 in agent wallet.
+
+Max 20 analysis reports/day.
+
+Verified contracts stored with SHA-256 hash.
+
+User must explicitly approve any on-chain attestation.
+
+11. “Winning Factor”
+
+Emphasize the most important innovation:
+
+The agent produces verifiable, tamper-proof security reports using its own on-chain identity (ERC-6551).
+
+Proof of authenticity
+
+Impossible for centralized AI to fake
+
+Demonstrates full autonomous AI behavior on Base
+
+12. 5-Min Demo Script
+
+Show exactly how to present:
+
+Paste suspicious contract
+
+AI runs analysis
+
+Shows “⚠️ This contract can drain your wallet”
+
+AI signs report from ERC-6551 wallet
+
+On-chain attestation appears in Base explorer
+
+Show shareable report link
+
+Done — judges immediately understand value
+
